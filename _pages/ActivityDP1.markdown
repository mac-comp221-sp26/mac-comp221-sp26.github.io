## Learning Goals

You will work towards being able to...

1. Design dynamic programming solutions to algorithmic problems


## Activity
For each of the following questions, (1) design a recurrence relation, (2) provide pseudocode for a naive D&C solution, and finally (3) develop a dynamic programming algorithm to solve it. Consider the time and space complexity of your solutions. **It WILL be helpful to play around with the problem specification to build intution (i.e., work through an example!) before jumping to designing an algorithm**.

1. (Skiena 10-1) A child running up a staircase can hop between 1 and $k$ steps at a time. Suppose the staircase is $n$ steps tall. How many unique ways can the child climb the staircase? If you prefer a more math-y framing, how many unique sequences of integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_l$, where $\forall 1 \leq i \leq l, 1 \leq s_i \leq k$ exist such that $\sum s_i = n$?

2. (Skiena 10-5) Consider an $s$ x $t$ grid $G$ filled with non-negative numbers. Find a "path" from the top left to bottom right corner than minimizes the sum of numbers along the path. That is, you start at the top-left corner, and at each step can choose to move down within the same column or right within the same row. 

#### Submission
Submit an artifact of your work on Moodle. You need not complete every (or even any) part, but you are responsible for eventually understanding how these problems work!
