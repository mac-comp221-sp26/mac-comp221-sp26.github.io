</ol>

<h2 id="activity">Activity</h2>
<p>For each of the following questions, design a recurrence relation, and then provide pseudocode for a dynamic programming algorithm to solve it. Consider the time and space complexity of your solutions. <strong>It may be helpful to play around with the problem specification to build intution (i.e., work through an example!) before jumping to designing an algorithm</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>(Skiena 10-6) Modify the edit distance algorithm we’ve discussed to allow for <em>transposition errors</em>, where at the cost of one operation, you can swap two adjacent characters. Convince yourself that your recurrence works, and run your pseudocode on the “steve”/”setve” pair Skiena gives you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Skiena 10-7) Suppose you have 3 strings, $x, y, z$, where $\lvert z \rvert = \lvert x \rvert + \lvert y \rvert$. $z$ is a shuffle of $x$ and $y$ if it interleaves characters from $x$ and $y$ preserving their order. That is, you take $x$ and insert all characters of $y$ into the string such that the order of characters in $y$ are preserved. See Skiena 10-7a for examples — confirm that they make sense! Then write a dynamic programming algorithm (based on the structure of edit distance!) that determines whether $z$ is a shuffle of $x$ and $y$.</p>
