<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Work with your groups on the following problems. You may work on them in any order:</p>

<h4 id="problem-1-two-tabled-wedding-skiena-7-15">Problem 1: Two-Tabled Wedding (Skiena 7-15):</h4>
<p>You are organizing seating for a wedding where all guests in a list $V$ must be organized into two tables. You also have a list $E$ of pairs of people who hate each other. Discuss how you might, if possible, construct a table assignment that avoids any enemies being at the same table. What kind of a graph problem is this?</p>

<h4 id="problem-2-covering-for-a-friend-skiena-7-18">Problem 2: Covering for a Friend (Skiena 7-18)</h4>
<p>A <em>Vertex Cover</em> for a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set $V’ \subset V$ (a subset of $V$ such that ever edge is <em>incident</em> to some $v \in V’$ (formally, $\forall (v_1, v_2) \in E$, either $v_1 \in V’$ or $v_2 \in V’$). Informally, this just means for every edge, at least one vertex on the end of that edge is in $V’$.</p>

<p>Suppose you have $\lvert V \rvert$ people working on $\lvert E \rvert$ projects in teams of 2. You want to organize a meeting where at least one person on each project is present to talk about progress on that project. This is a vertex cover problem — identify the vertices and edges of the implicit graph and convince yourself the solution is a vertex cover!</p>

<p>Skiena 7-18 suggests one algorithm for finding a vertex cover is building a DFS tree and pruning the leaves. Construct an argument, given what you know about edges in a DFS tree, that this is always a vertex cover. Note that by Skiena’s definition, we disallow self-edges in our graphs! Also note that this is not required to be a minimum vertex cover, so don’t worry about optimality!</p>

<h4 id="problem-3-maximizing-utility">Problem 3: Maximizing Utility</h4>
<p>Suppose you are a utility company contracted by a local government to connect a collection of houses to the utility grid. You’ve surveyed the site and determined the cost to connect each pair of buildings, including one that links up to the main grid. You would like to maximize the cost of connecting buildings (since you take a percentage of that cost as profit), but your contract specifies that you won’t be paid for redundant connections (connecting two buildings that are otherwises connected through another path in the grid). Find an efficient algorithm to compute the set of building-to-building connects that will maximize the cost to the local government.</p>

<h4 id="problem-4-a-stop-along-the-way-skiena-8-19">Problem 4: A Stop Along the Way (Skiena 8-19)</h4>

<p>Suppose you have a set of cities and edges representing roads connecting them. Edges are weighted with the travel time between the relevant cities. Determine an algorithm to find the shortest path between city $s$ and city $t$ that makes a stop at city $v$ along the way!</p>

<h4 id="problem-5-height-limited-shortest-paths-skiena-8-22">Problem 5: Height Limited Shortest Paths (Skiena 8-22)</h4>

<p>Suppose you have a set of cities and of roads connecting pairs of cities. For each road, you are told the maximum allowable height of a vehicle navigating that road. Construct an algorithm to find the maximum height of a vehicle that could successfully transit from city $s$ to city $t$.</p>
