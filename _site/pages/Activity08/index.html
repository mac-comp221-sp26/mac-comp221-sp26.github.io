<p>You will work towards being able to…</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Understand sorting as a pre-processing step for solving common algorithmic problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn algorithmic ideas into pseudocode</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Work with your groups on the following problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sorting for Search</strong>: As Skiena tells us, preprocessing an array with a sorting algorithm lets us use Binary Search instead of Linear Search to find some element. If we only search the array once, is this a good strategy? How many times must we search in order for preprocessing with an $\Theta(n \log n)$ sort to be worth it? Make an argument in terms of Big-Oh time complexities. Note that this is a form of amortized analysis!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Good-Enough Subset Sum</strong>: Given an array $A$ of Integers and an Integer $k$, find a set $S$ that contains the maximum number of elements in $A$ that sum to $\leq k$. For example, If you were given $A = [4, 2, 8, -1, 7]$ and $k = 3$, we should find either $S = {2, -1}$ or $S = {4, -1}$. Provide pseudocode for a solution and provide an informal analysis of it’s time complexity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Maximum Gap</strong>: Given an array $A$ of Integers, find the pair of Integers $a, b \in A$, $a &lt; b$ such that (1) there is no $c \in A$ such that $a &lt; c &lt; b$ and (2) $\lvert a - b \rvert$ is maximized. That is, find an element $a$ such that the next largest element in $A$, $b$, is as far away as possible. For example, given $A = [4, 2, 1, 14, -7]$, you should find the pair $(4, 10)$. Again, provide pseudocode and an informal analysis of it’s time complexity. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>k-Tuple Sum</strong>: Given an array $A$ of $n$ integers and an integer $t$, find an $O(n^{k-1}\log n)$ algorithm to test whether $k$ of the integers in $S$ add up to $t$ <em>(Skiena 4-9)</em>.</p>

      <p>This is a variation on LeetCode problem 164! They ask you to do this in <em>Linear</em> time &amp; space, which isn’t doable with $\Theta(n \log n)$ sort preprocessing, unfortunately. However, the idea is still to preprocess with sorting! <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
